Our goal in this project is to predict the outcome of a National Basket- ball Association game using past game statistics. We use a MultiLayered perceptron to predict Win - Loss as well as game scores, achieving a max- imum accuracy of 89%. We have also iterated over all possibilities of available features to ascertain which statistical variable has the maximum impact on testing accuracy.

Through our project we wanted to determine the possible benefits and limitations of using just game statistics. Feature set importance give us insight on what game strategies are a better predictor of game results in the current NBA seasons.
